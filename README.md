This is a current weather app I built for FreeCodeCamp. It uses the Google geolocation and OpenWeatherMap API's to display the weather in the user's city. It allows users to toggle between degrees Fahrenheit and Celsius without refreshing the page.

Things I learned in this project:
  -How to use the Google geolocation API to avoid the popup asking to use users' location
  -Using Font Awesome icons as background images (although they didn't make it into the final design)
  -Using the "text-center" bootstrap attribute on the outside container to center everything on the page
